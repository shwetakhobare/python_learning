## Getting Started

# Agile Framework Overview

This document provides a brief overview of the Agile framework, a set of principles and practices that emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centric solutions in project management.

## Key Aspects of Agile

1. **Iterative Development**
   - Work is divided into small, manageable units called iterations or sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks.
   - Enables frequent reassessment and adaptation.

2. **Collaboration**
   - Promotes close collaboration among cross-functional teams, including developers, designers, testers, and customer representatives.

3. **Customer Feedback**
   - Regular feedback from stakeholders and customers is integrated into the development process.
   - Ensures the final product meets their needs.

4. **Flexibility**
   - Agile is adaptable to changes even late in the development process.
   - Teams can quickly pivot as project requirements evolve.

5. **Self-organizing Teams**
   - Teams are empowered to make decisions.
   - Encourages creativity and ownership of the project.

6. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Encourages regular reflection on processes and outcomes.
   - Fosters an environment of constant learning and improvement.

## Popular Agile Methodologies

- **Scrum**: A framework that uses fixed-length iterations called sprints and emphasizes daily stand-up meetings.
- **Kanban**: Focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and improving flow.
- **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Emphasizes technical excellence and good design practices.

## Conclusion

Agile provides a flexible and efficient approach to project management, enabling teams to deliver high-quality products that meet customer needs in a dynamic environment.

# Software Development and Testing Life Cycles

This document provides an overview of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC), outlining the key steps involved in each process.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**
   - Collect and analyze business needs.
   - Document requirements.

2. **Design**
   - High-Level Design (HLD): Architecture, data flow, and system interfaces.
   - Low-Level Design (LLD): Detailed design of components.

3. **Implementation (Coding)**
   - Convert design into code.
   - Follow coding standards and guidelines.

4. **Testing**
   - Verify and validate the developed software.
   - Identify and fix defects.

5. **Deployment**
   - Release the software to production.
   - Monitor for issues post-deployment.

6. **Maintenance**
   - Provide ongoing support and updates.
   - Address any new requirements or bugs.

## Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Understand and analyze testing requirements.
   - Identify testable requirements.

2. **Test Planning**
   - Prepare the test strategy and plan.
   - Determine resources, timeline, and scope.

3. **Test Case Development**
   - Write detailed test cases.
   - Prepare test data.

4. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Configure hardware and software for testing.
   - Ensure the environment is ready for execution.

5. **Test Execution**
   - Execute test cases.
   - Log defects for any failures.

6. **Test Closure**
   - Evaluate test cycle completion criteria.
   - Prepare test closure report and metrics.

## Conclusion

Understanding the SDLC and STLC processes is crucial for delivering high-quality software. Each step ensures that development and testing are systematically addressed to meet business and user needs.
